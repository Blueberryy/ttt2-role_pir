The Pirate Captain spawns with an item called the ‘Contract’. The Contract doesn’t have any direct abilities. It is, however, what binds the Pirates to another player: If the Captain throws the Contract and it gets picked up by someone, all Pirates are automatically on the same team as this person, their 'master'. The Pirates doesn’t gain the teammate's abilities, but they can follow his orders and basically becomes somewhat of a sidekick

However, since the Contract is what binds the Pirates to his team: When the master dies, the Contract is dropped. Whoever picks it up will be the Pirates new boss.
But there is another clue: if the Captain dies the Contract gets removed and a new Captain is designated among the Pirates. The new Captain is not bound to the vows his predecessor made and can search for a new master on his own.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.

[h1]Normal Role Convars (also found in ULX):[/h1]
[code]# enable or disable this role
  ttt_pir_enabled [0/1] (default: 1) 
# the percentage of players that are spawned as Pirate
  ttt_pir_pct [0.0..1.0] (default: 1.0)
# the limit of players that spawn as Pirate each round, this overwrites the percentage
  ttt_pir_max [0..n] (default: 1) 
# the probability each round of Pirates being spawned at all
  ttt_pir_random [0..100] (default: 50) 
# the amount of players needed for Pirates to spawn
  ttt_pir_min_players: [0..n] (default: 8)[/code]
